# DWD Weather Data Converter

This repository holds all data concerning the weather data converter for converting weather data from the German Weather Service (DWD) [https://www.dwd.de/DE/Home/home_node.html].

It is accessing the data stored in the ftp server and the user can select needed data in order to create a weather data file (epw, c6b) that can be used for simulations (SIM-VICUS, DELPHIN, etc.)
