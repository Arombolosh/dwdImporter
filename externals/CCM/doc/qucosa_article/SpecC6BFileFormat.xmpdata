\Title{DELPHIN 6 Climate Data File Specification, Version 1.0}
\Author{Andreas Nicolai}
\Subject{Abstract This paper describes the file format of the climate data container used by the DELPHIN, THERAKLES and NANDRAD simulation programs. The climate data container format holds a binary representation of annual and continuous climatic data needed for hygrothermal transport and building energy simulation models. The content of the C6B-Format is roughly equivalent to the epw-climate data format.}
