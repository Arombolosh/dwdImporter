File format ccd
===============

Format requirements
-------------------
File may contain comments. Lines with comments begin with a # character.

First non-empty line in file is the header line, with format:

<keyword> <unit>

followed by an empty line. Afterwards, data section follows row based, each row contains 5 columns:
<day of year>  <hour> <minutes> <seconds> <value>

Alternatively, use : (colon) to separate hour, minutes and seconds.
<day of year>  <hour>:<minutes>:<seconds> <value>

Content requirements
--------------------
Value ranges:

day of year >= 0   (integer value)
0 <= hour <= 23    (integer value)
0 <= minutes <= 59 (integer value)
0 <= seconds <  60 (floating point value)

When defining annual data, the file must start with 
  0  1 0 0 <value>
and end with
365  0 0 0 <value> 

Value interpretation
--------------------
A time-value pair is interpreted as point. Between points linear
interpolation is used.


Example

# CCD file example, temperature data type
TEMPER C

  0  1 0 0 -8
  ...
  more annual values
  ...
364 22 0 0 -3
364 23 0 0 -4
365  0 0 0 -7
