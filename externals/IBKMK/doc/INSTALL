Information about the IBK Library
=================================

Files in the library root directory
-----------------------------------
  README        - this file
  ChangeLog     - recent changes to the library
  COPYING       - formulation of the Lesser GNU Public License
  AUTHORS       - copyright and contact information
  CMakeList.txt - build information for CMake

Subdirectories
--------------
  src           - contains the sources and include files of the IBK lib
  src/examples  - example source code that demonstrates some features of the IBK lib
  doc           - IBK library API documentation
  projects      - contains some project files for various IDEs

Compiling
---------
Compiling the IBK lib is very simple. You need a fairly new C++ compiler. The
library has been successfully compiled with both Borland C++ compiler 5.5 and
GCC 3.2. Project files for various IDEs and compilers have been added for 
your convenience. Also the compiler independent CMAKE build-system is included.

Before compiling you need to create a IBK_configuration.h file. You can do this
manually by copying the IBK_configuration.h.in file to IBK_configuration.h and
editing it (enable/disable desired defines). Or you can use the CMAKE 
configuration framework.


Have fun and please report any bugs or wishes to me!
