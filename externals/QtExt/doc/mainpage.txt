\mainpage Overview of the QtExt Library

\section intro_sec What is the QtExt library?

The QtExt is something like the IBK library for Qt-specific extensions. It currently contains
widgets that extend the Qt widget library and reporting components.

All classes and types are wrapped in the QtExt namespace.

\subsection widgets QtExt Widgets

The following widgets may be useful.

- QtExt::ValidatingLineEdit - A widget for line edits that provide input value checking
- QtExt::ColorEditWidget - A widget that allows editing of colors (e.g. in preferences dialogs)
- QtExt::ColorButton - A tool button that displays its color and opens a color selection widget when clicked.

Uniform appearance of widgets is controlled through the QtExt::Style class static members.

\subsection report Several classes assist with report generation.

See QtExt::Report for details.
